# gitlab_project_variable (Resource)

This resource allows you to create and manage CI/CD variables for your GitLab projects.
For further information on variables, consult the [gitlab
documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/variables/README.html#variables).

~> **Important:** If your GitLab version is older than 13.4, you may see nondeterministic behavior
when updating or deleting `gitlab_project_variable` resources with non-unique keys, for example if
there is another variable with the same key and different environment scope. See
[this GitLab issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/9912).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "gitlab_project_variable" "example" {
  project   = "12345"
  key       = "project_variable_key"
  value     = "project_variable_value"
  protected = false
}
```

```
